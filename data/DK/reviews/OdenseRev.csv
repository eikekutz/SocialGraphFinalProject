Second of all when we met her we immediately got into deep philosophical conversations which I also love because there is always a new perspective and knowledge about everything. I would’ve loved to stay 1 more night to talk more and explore together something that would be new for both of us!

I also would like to mention her personality which is super comfortable. I especially noticed her laughing. When you hear it, you can clearly hear honest happiness through!🌸

I want to wish the best of luck in life for you, also on your next Dublin trip, the application of the Olympics work and the teaching of children!🥃✨

It doesn't sound like much, but to me its brave, especially considering I have a few years on him. But what a host he was. He took me out, introduced me to pretty girls, showed excellent knowledge of his city and H.C. Andersen, and went out of his way to make me feel entertained. He even escorted me to another hosts place when he could not continue having me stay due to prior commitments.
