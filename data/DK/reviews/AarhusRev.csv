We spent a lot of time together so we had very interesting conversations.

I must say the food was awesome! We also walked a lot around Milano enjoying my favourite places of the city with them. 

Dani is a super happy, funny and positive person full of energy. She is very considerate, wise, talkative… and much more of good adjectives. And she is super clean! The kitchen was all time tidy and clean, even more than when she came! 

Tim also shares all these positive adjectives so I’m not going to repeat them, I will just say: Give him a guitar and enjoy!

Concluding, hosting people at home and taking care of them is a bit tiring, but when you find people like Dani and Tim it fully deserves! You learn about their experiences, philosophy of life, knowledge… I like CS because it helps me to grow as a person, and this is thanks to people like them. So thank you! :)

What else? ;)

I had accepted his emergency request and hosted him 2 nights during new year, as well as hosted him a second time middle of January. On arrival he bought some beers and then we went to the Couchsurfing New Year Party and Khao San road. Another time we went to the floating market.

Nick is a smart guy, polite, funny and friendly. He is the 'perfect' couchsurfer and i'm glad he was here. Also he ate (nearly) everything i had cooked, haha :-))
