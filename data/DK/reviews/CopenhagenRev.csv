It's a shame that I didn't get enough time to hangout with him cz I had to leave early in the morning.

That was one of those things I'd not imagine doing it myself.

I really wish I could stay more since I rarely stayed only one day as a guest. It made me feel like I just need a place to sleep. Next summer Camilla! We should seriously plan some trips together! Or we can meet up again and go from there!

If you are lucky to be hosted by Camilla, make sure you ask her about her sailing stories and decorate her little poster she uses to keep memories of her guests!!! 

Thank you again for hosting me Camilla<3 We should keep in touch here or on Facebook and best of luck with you job search I'm sure you'd find one pretty soon!!!

Fernando is very positive, hospitable and always smiling guy with a good sense of humor.

I need to say more about music - Fernando is a big music fan and he also a guitar and piano player, we even realized that we have  few favorites bands in common!  

Fernando showed us a nice place, called Bastard Cafe, where you can grab some beer, tea, etc., and play board games. We spent there3 hours playing board games :) Also he has his own google map page with good places to visit for tourists. 

Fernando was very kind and he let us use his bikes to take a trip to a beach not so far from his place.

20056415,"That was a classical example of bad match of the surfer and the host.
Antonello keeps telling that CS has changed and people don't understand CS spirit now. What he means it that he gains less profit from his Couchsurfers now. So, let me describe Antonello's perfect surfer:
She's a free girl who doesn't mind sharing the bed, blanket, pillow, preferably friend with benefits. Pole dancers welcomed (seriously, he showed me around 30 photos of half-naked girl in pole dance poses, saying over and over again""she was such a good surfer, so beautiful""),  who welcomes host with crate of beers and 1-hour full-body massage (another two examples of Antonello's best surfers). She parties whole night, smokes weed, drinks rivers of alkohol and next morning clean ups everything. If the description matches you, Antonello is your perfect host. Mine wasn't.
He was hard to reach on the phone and didn't answer messages back. The first day when we suppose to ""stay in touch"", until 22:00 I couldn't contact him and didn't know if I have or don't have place to stay. And when I finally reached his place, he was surprised to see me! Or maybe too drank and stoned to remeber that he suppose to host me.
When I reached the place, it was a party with lots of alkohol and weed there. It could  feel overwhelming but actually his friends and flatmates turned out to be the best part of my staying at Antonello's house. Warm, full of energy and curious, during that one night they spoke with me more than Antonllo during my whole stay. I wish I could spend more time with them, but they disapper the next morning.
And yes, I was aware he offers shared bed and I kindly choosed floor. What I was not aware of that he won't give me any pillow or blanket, which brings me to the question- if I share the bed with him, would we also share pillow and blanket? Seems too intimate for a CS for me... So I slept like a homeless, using my clothes and scarfs as a pillow and cover.
The house was also extremely dirty, just being in the kitchen after the party was a biohazard (seriously- I can send you photos!). And, funny thing- I guess Antonello except me to clean all that mess for exchange to his great ""hospitality"". 
And when he asked me how is his hosting and I replied ""acceptable"" he said "" acceptable? Such a high expectation for a Couchsurfer"" like offering roof above the head should make me to praise him like God.
So, Antonello was not a good CS host. Actually, my worse cs experience ever.

It was the beginning of an experience I enjoyed every single second of, and will remember for a long time. That would be very hard to sum up everything I enjoyed when I stayed with Lars, but among the most remarkable things I would say that I really felt transported by all the stories about Copenhagen (and not only!) Lars told me, the places he brought me to and adviced me to go to. I had the very great chance to immerse myself in Danish way of life for those two days, and really made the most of my stay despite Copenhagen high prices thanks to Lars's help and devotion. Last but not least, the house is the most comfortable I could have wished of. 

I had the great chance to have lots of interests in common with Lars, but I would honestly blindly recommend anyone to stay with him after this so fun and interesting stay.

He picked us up from the airport by car, drove us to the city, and drove us few times from and to the train station making our life much easier. During our stay at his place we had breakfast and dinner together plus late by night we watched movies with him and always had a very nice conversation.

I with my friend was supposed to stay for 2 nights in Denmark. Before coming we had nice conversations and arranged some plans. We arrived early morning and spend all day in the city; it was nice of her to pick up us to her place with the car. Until that everything was smooth, we were sharing experiences, etc. The fact that made us not stay for the second night was her ‚Äòrequest‚Äô to carry a big couch for about 1 km to her house. We were really tired that day and still had to spend our whole next day walking, so we refused. Her attitude afterwards wasn‚Äôt pleasant at all and I consider that trying to take advantage of us is not this community‚Äôs goal. As for me, I tried to do my best to not complicate the situation; we cooked, did the dishes and even cleaned the cooker (even if it was dirty before). It is really hard to stay in a place where you do not feel honestly welcomed. Id strongly believe it could happen to anyone to have a bad day, but treating someone unfairly while you‚Äôve subscribed for taking part in this kind of program makes me think that everyone is always doing a favor while demanding for smth in return.

There's always someone to hang out with and It really feels like a big family of strangers living together in a friendly athmosphere. During our stay there we met a lot of cool, interesting people from the most varied backgrounds that we'll certainly remain friends with in the future.

We enjoyed good conversations, movies, dinners with Jo and the other couchsurfers, we even painted together on a canvas!

She is incredibly giving. Many of the couchsurfers that passed through her doors over the course of the week I was there expressed their extreme gratitude to have someone so open to helping as many people find a place to stay. Every night we would hang out on her back porch in the comfortable Danish countryside air, drink beers, chat, and occasionally watch the fire twirling performances of a fellow couchsurfer. It was a unique experience living in a house with so many people from all over busily making food each evening for every one to share, and Jo was at the center of it all, even if she was always to modest to make herself so.

Definitely the most funny walk ever! I'm so glad that i had the chance to get this amazing and really authentic experience of Denmark. 

Thanks a lot, Claus!

One evening we ""tried"" to go out (the town where I lived had little to offer but we still found a bar and a late night pizza).

First of all, Thank you so much for everything. I really appreciate you hosted me and Sophia in your beautiful home and I am super happy we met in Copenhagen. 

I met Jon at a cs 'meetup' and we spent an afternoon together, with two other couchsurfers. During the evening he realised that me and my friend, Sophia, did not have a place to stay for the weekend back then. So he offered us to stay at his place for two nights. It was really last minute and it was an amazing experience for me. People like Jon always remind me on why I love to use cs. Meeting this individual personalities from all over the world. Having random talks about life and sharing a great time together. 

We went to a food market, had some beers in Christianshaven (not sure how to write that and too lazy to google haha), walked around the city, went to a beautiful park and chatted a lot. Jon welcomed me in his home like if he is welcoming a friend. Things like that are amazing while traveling. He is a generous and helpful guy and my stay was amazing.

he seems to be an interesting character; but, like

One should add that Glenn's flat is not for

From the moment I wanted to write to Thor with some technical Couchsurfing difficulties to the moment he wrote back it's all seemed so uncertain.
We came on a Friday morning after a long night on the bus. The tall man with long yellow-white hair greeted us. We climbed the staircases and came into this super cozy apartment on the top floor that crosses the building and has this wonderful windows on both sides of it.
Thor was open and simply ready to talk about any subjects and just hang right away. He gave us bikes with no question at all and showed us the nice spots around. I also was lucky to try the special bike, similar to the one people had like 150 years ago, with a huge back weel and small front one, only the whole bike is in a smaller scale.
Anyway, this was such a cool experience and this 2,5 days in Copenhagen were amazing as we both got to hang out with Thor and get to know him and even meet his brother. Plus the time for exploring the city just walking and biking was so short but so precious. The after the bridge spot near the river was so great due to the weather and company.
I would describe this person so honest, true and knowing what he wants. Around a mess, he knows his way, as probably every artistic human being. I'm sure he can tell You so much You still don't know concerning art, poetry, music etc, and he'll gladly hear your own perspectives.

Very recently i added a new name on top of the list of the most adorable places in europe: k√∏penhavn. Staying with Thor was like visiting a good old friend, the fanciest it-girl of the city and your favorite uncle at the same time. He picked me up with his sofa-bike, gave me a tour through the city, introduced me to his lovely friend who gave us a history tour through christiania, (Both have been living in K√ò for more than 20years!), took care that i get lots of free beer (without  buying me beer, cause thats not the job of a host) and was funny and classy all the time. Smart, enthusiastic, interesting and nice human beeing, relaxed and trusting. Friday night he took us to a party of the K√ò jazzszene, live music food drinks all night long. Very special experience. I hope we see each other again soon! Hope you like the marx brothers a little bit. Thank you, Thorbj√∏rn!

He was a very obliging guest, and was happy to work around my schedule, even when I wouldn't be home until late. When it came time for me to stay at his place, I found that he'd packed his place with about half a dozen couchsurfers, so we were crammed into every available space. I thought this was great because it meant that I could meet and hang out with loads of other surfers, and I really enjoyed the experience (and the pancake party on my second night!). However if you're the sort of person who likes their privacy and downtime then you may want to check first because his place isn't that big (although the location is amazing and very beautiful).

22800436,"When I first contacted Rasmus, it was not to ask to stay, but because I¬¥d been ""WOW-ed"" by his profile - I mean who else has ever lived in Greenland! From that point on, we messaged a bit on and of and when the time came that I needed a place in Copenhagen, Rasmus was very forthcoming in offering to host me despite having plans that night. 

While my stay was only a couple of hours long due to arriving late (which also was not a problem at all for Rasmus) and having an early bus to catch (also no problem, and advice to others: just be mindful that it¬¥s early, you¬¥re in an old building with thin walls and you¬¥re not alone; others are still sleeping!) , I really enjoyed the time we spent chatting over dinner leftovers. It¬¥s all true about his flatmate by the way - he's the world's best, no doubt about it! They¬¥re both amazing people with many experiences to share despite their young age and a lot of stories to tell! 

So, the sleeping arrangements at Rasmus' place have been criticised before, but I see absolutely no reason  why other than their idea of Couchsurfing not living up to high expectations of, say,  a 5 star hotel! I had my sleeping bag with me, but I wouldn't have needed it as everything was there, blanket, pillow, mattress/couch, and Rasmus even cranked up the heating in case I would be cold sleeping in the living room. Other than that, I got a short tour of his flat with explanations and how-to¬¥s to everything so I wouldn't be lost not knowing how to work the shower or use the kitchen. 

All things considered, including the awesome flatmate and his snake Victoria II, I don't think I could have found a better place to stay. The location is great, with buses running to the centre and to Valby bus station from the nearby main street, there¬¥s a big supermarket just round the corner and for those who like to walk, like me, the city centre is within walking distance! 

I could go on and on about all the reasons why my one day one night in Copenhagen was so good (I saw a viking at Nyhavn!) but coming to Rasmus' place at night and just feeling welcome in their relaxed chilled out home was definitely a big part of the whole experience! 

To wrap this up, Rasmus is a top-notch, 10/10 host, I¬¥m feeling extremely lucky to have stayed at his place, and if he accepts your request, so should you!

i got a call around 23 in the evening, as i was pirating around for a place to sleep and 30 minutes later i get picked up by agata.

Surprized by their hospitality and openness. This was my first CS'ing, but surely not my last :)

Everything was just perfect, well organised and ideal!
Beautiful and very clean home,nice and funny evenings together,good tips about the city,stories sharing about life and travellings,etc.,etc.,etc....üòä
I liked staying in his house cause I felt like I was with some good and well known friend ‚ù§ It was easy to be with him and I enjoyed his company.. (I hope him too..not sure though..hehe...üòÅüòâ)
I also occupied his bed,so he had no solution but to sleep on the floor...
I felt sad about it..But it would be uncomfortable for me to sleep on the floor ..you know...üòâüòÅ
He is a real Gentleman and very nice guy!!!
You are very lucky if he decides to host you!!

P.S 
Louis, I wish all your wishes come true!!!
And you are always welcome in my home whenever and wherever!!!",2016-12-21T22:37:22Z,positive,surf,True,1002346179,2003576557,Julia Zdzitowiecka,136038547,"G√ºtersloh, Germany",https://s3.amazonaws.com/ht-images.couchsurfing.com/u/2003576557/9cf4e554-8dad-435e-be39-f4e71967ca23,maybe,False,False,,,
