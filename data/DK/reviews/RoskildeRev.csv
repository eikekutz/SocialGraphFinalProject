Our stay at Josefine‚Äôs was short, but It was a great place to be for our first couchsurfing experience. 
The house was really big, tidy with all the comforts and lots of friendly people in it. We met there other couchsurfers from all over the world. That makes her house very enjoyable and it‚Äôs a positive and unique place.

I surely recommend Josefine as a host, and if I would ever have a chance to be around there once, I would surely stay again or at least drop in.
