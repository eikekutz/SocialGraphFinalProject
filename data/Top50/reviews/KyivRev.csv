His home has a fantastic view, very clean and so organized, tidy! He offered me a comfy and clean couch and i felt like home.

I stayed at his home for 5 days but sadly we havent had much time because he was so busy and i was outside till late night mostly, but in that short times he always had a smiley face and full of positive energy!

Also he told me about ukranian history and gave good advices about kiev. He is very heplful, intelligent, talented (he is a great guitar player) and elegant. 

Sergiy travelled a lot so he has amazing, funny stories!

If Sergiy accept you, it means you are the luckiest person in kiev, really :)

I had a great time and experience in Kiev with him! All the best :-)
He showed me the city spending a little bit of his time with me - that was really nice and kind.
He also gave me a lot of local hints, explained to me the things in general regarding language and culture and daily life. He took me even for a Theater in Ukrainian language. Hehehe That‚Äôs was nice to watch but hard for me to understand, once I merely can say Hi (Privjet) and Thanks (Spasibo) ahahha ‚Äì I learned also with him.
Another funny thing, at least for me, the whole time we just spoke with each other in German. Funny some way some how, I'm from Brazil, he from Ukraine and German Language, instead English. So, now you know, if you want to try to speak another languages ‚Äì Ukrainian and German hehehe go for it.
Definitely I recommend to meet him!!

So now when I came to Kyiv to visit my friends from my previous university I decided to ask Andriy if he could host me. And although it was just the day before my arrival, he accepted me to his home.
He was very hospitable, cooked ukrainian-style fried potato just as my mom does and let me do the laundry. He also was OK that I came at night.
And although at first I planned more to hang out with my best old university friends whom I haven't seen for quite a long time, I was glad that Andriy joined us, because he fit just perfectly, there was a feeling as if everybody knew him for years.
Pity that I had such a short stay in Kyiv, but when I come next time, I will definitely stay with Andriy again!

As a person, Alex is an interesting guy with lots of experience in hitchhiking and couchsurfing. It was very interesting to listen his stories and be amazed at his braveness in life and in travelling. 

As a host, he is amazingly generous that he had given all of his time available with me. To be honest I was really really touched because of that.
He was showing the city to me every day I stayed, even after his tiring regular work. I really appreciate that he was trying to make my stay comfortable in every detail. Alex also introduced his friends to me and I had learned a few Russian slangs and phrases from them, had the interesting conversations with them. It made me get in touch the culture deeply through Alex.  Because of him, I have a super great and positive impression on Ukraine and Ukrainian people.

We spent wonderful time together talking about everything, she loves adventure activities and she invited me to practice trampolin, it was my first time! Now I love it and I will practice it again when I get chile! we walked around the city, she introduced me to her friends... I felt like I know her for years. 
I would highly recommend anyone to host, meet up or stay with Helena. I'm very sure you will have an excellent experience too. If you're given the opportunity to meet or host Helena, take it!

Even though Galina and her family have a pretty full schedule they decided to accept me as their first guest. We did several city walks, had nice meals together and exchanged a lot of ideas!  
As both children are learning English and French they were eager to practice their language skills.
As their appartment is not directly in the centre we usually went for and back by car so I did not really figure out if there is an effective way to get to their place by public transportation ;-) 

You are a great family! Thanks again! Come and visit us in Berlin!

Katry is simple gril, and really smart. With her you can laugh about pretty much everything, and talk about everything as well. 
Other you wanna chill or go out she is your girl. 
I guess it's useless to describe her, you should definitely just meet her ;)

Alex gave me a different point of view about the revolution in Ukraine, and was really interesting to listen to his stories about life, hicthhiking, and yeah...he also told me two or three things about signs and symbols around us :D

I like CS because it gives you the chance to meet people with the same ""hobbies"" but also that could open you a new world! That was my experience with Alex, and now I have a mission to do...:-)

He opened his sweet house, which is in great location with may attractions in walking distance, to us and made us feel as VIP guests. The house was super clean and he provided us with clean sheets. He is a great cook and he cooked for us several times during our 3 day stay. The words are not enough to express how grateful we are for this gentle soul. Although I enjoyed every bit of long conversations we had, I enjoyed the dark humors the most. It is not often that one comes across someone and clicks right away.

When I arrived at his place, he made a great meal (he's a great cook - these cr√™pes with cherry he made were extremely delicious) and after that he showed me around the city (which was really nice) and we talked and talked on great variety of things. The next day we decided to meet up again and he led me to the couchsurfing meeting which was one of the highlights of my 2 week journey across Europe. He's a very, very pleasant person with great sense of humour (well I really enjoyed his ironic/sarcastic jokes as I usually do the same :p).

21884467,"Artyom stayed my place for 5 nights. It was nice to host him.
It was an emergency request, so I couldn't provide him with the guest sleeping place all the time of his staying. So in fact 3 night he used to sleep just on the small extra couch in my room, but he was ok with that. So he is flexible and easy-going person.
Artyom has traveled a lot, so he has a lot to tell, but he is self organized, which is great for me as for the host. He is responsible and accurate as well. 
All the time during his staying he was polite. He became friends with my dog, has been always friendly.
Also he is knowledgeable person, actually he knew more than me about Saint Petersburg, so gave me some tips about the museums, haha) He liked the ballet that I have arranged for him etc. 
Well, in general it was nice experience. Recommend.

Nick is very relaxed, hospitable, and easy to talk to. He's done his fair share of travelling resulting in a fair share of excellent tales. Tallahassee's resident bar mogul, he knows where to go every night, and seemingly all the staff.
We got along so well he ended up joining me on a spontaneous trip to southern Louisiana where we brought in the new year with our exceptional zydeco skills. He made an effort of showing me all he knew of Cajun culture and new Orleans (if you're ever there, get a drive through daquiri [daiquiri?], but hey, they don't put a straw in it). Additionally, he introduced me to the wacky world of college football. Go FSU!...wait.

18437219,"Me and my girlfriend arranged an extremely last minute stay at Anton's for two nights. Due to a relatively complex series of events (we had one host that fell through, and a second host that could host us for the first of two nights who then got ill), our plans were very fluid. Anton, however, was completely gracious in first being able to host us for the second night but then also the first night at the last moment.

We first met with Anton after the Kyiv-Chelsea game (0-0, but a good game), which we both attended, albeit it separately. Afterwards Anton took us back to his flat, offered us drinks, and spent a good few hours hanging out with us and just chatting about stuff/life. He has a conceirge in his building, so he was able to leave his keys with us, which allowed us to lie-in beyond his earlier wake up time. We then met up in the evening again, had some beers, watched some more football (Real Madrid-PSG, 0-0, not that great a match) after which we spent some more time talking. 

Anton is a really interesting and friendly person, he was really easy to chat to, and I would not hesitate to recommend that people should stay with him! He has a super nice flat in fairly central location a short walk from a metro station. Me and my girlfriend shared a large sofa bed that was plenty big enough for the two of us which is sort of in the same room as Anton's bed but is sort of it's own room (it is one big room, but with a dividing wall in the middle that allows for privacy).

Thank you so much for hosting us Anton!

If you take an up-to-date encyclopedia of Kyiv, combine that with the energy of the Energizer Bunny (or is a cat?), put that in a human soul that treats you with genuine interest and care, and then multiply that by üíØ; you get someone that can probably come close to this gem of a person who kindly hosted me on my maiden CouchSurfing adventure.

Three days with her would feel like a lifetime (in a good way) and you'll return (or move onward) with a friend to cherish.

So would I recommend Natalie?

Well, if you are a host and lucky enough that you receive a request from her, I strongly encourage that you do not spare a moment least someone else shows the good judgement before you do and you miss on this incredible chance to meet her.

And if you are a surfer, make sure you take professional help to draft your couch request, get  a second review and they pray to the old gods and the new that she's not engaged in an adventure of her own.",2018-02-11T10:40:21Z,positive,surf,True,1001612052,2002479430,Adi üíØ,116175850,"San Jose, CA, USA",https://s3.amazonaws.com/ht-images.couchsurfing.com/u/2002479430/9062624a-3ffc-4232-bcfb-736dd19fb97f,hang,True,False,,,

25745684,"There only are positive words that come to my mind when I think of Igor. I feel I am lucky to have won such a sincere friend. He is one of the most considerate and tolerant  human-beings I have met in my life (in 80-ish countries!). From the first moment I step in, I felt like I was taking with a close friend from before (which is not always the case for me when meeting new people) thanks to his hospitality and inexplicable warm character that naturally opens up people's heart. Despite his mild manner, I saw his enthusiasm, spirit of adventure, generosity, flexibility and iron tolerance to cope with all sort of diversity (culture, customs, religion, people's different character, values and behaviour)    he takes a great interest in his guests, people, their countries, cultures, religion, values and so on.

He takes great care of his guest, is boundlessly generous, practices ""my home is your home"" as he claims(not everyone can do at his level) and always makes sure that his guests are okay, at ease, feel home and happy. I can't find a word to thank him enough! 

He is very curious about other cultures and local food in other countries(it would be a great idea if you can cook/bring something from your country as I did although he never asks his guests) and enjoys conversations about everything, so if you are just looking for a free place in a fancy condominium in the city centre just to crush on without any communication, he might not be for you, but if you are keen to meet genuine Ukranean hospitality and warmth, go sending a request!

Without a second thought, I would recommend Igor to anyone to host/meet/stay with! Thank you also for the delicious breakfasts and fantastic free-ranged boiled eggs that you brought from your friends farm in the countryside, Igor! Thanks a million and see you again bro!;)
Ps. He is knowledgeable about Kiev where he has been living for 5 years, but he is also happy to share his knowledge of his home town Lviv!:)

I am happy to have hosted the last moment, because I saw that they were in Kiev where I have great memories and always known wonderful people like them. Being with them every moment was enjoyable as if we know each other for a long time and we promised to review or even to Venice or again in Sicily.

I loved the time we were together, and I can‚Äôt thank them enough for the beautiful experience of hosting me.
I meet Ir√®ne after her working day, and we went to her and her mom apartment, where they welcome me with warm tea and a delicious dinner. Also, their apartment is super cosy and has this homey feeling that makes u feel very comfortable and at home.

Next day, me and Ir√®ne went together to the old town, where I visited around, and she went for work. We meet by the end of afternoon and at evening, I tried my cooking skills which Ir√®ne was kind enough to say they were good. After dinner, we played some card games and domino ‚Äì she is very good at it, I‚Äôve lost all the times. It was a very enjoyable evening between board games and nice conversation.

Alexander, I truly had an amazing time! See you again in Buenos Aires!

Alex took me to many beautiful and interesting places like several parks and gardens and markets (ferias) that we're going all over everywhere due to the festive days; the very famous graveyard where he could teach me some more about Argentinian history and the famous people who were buried there. We also had some nice local food (Bondiolas) directly by the river in Puerto Madero, where people dance salsa and tango by the sunset. Too bad, that it was so freezing cold as soon as the sun had set..
In the evening we came back to his place to have dinner and watch a really eyeopening Movie which was so intense that we remained discussing, philosophing and having really deep conversations about the changes and effects of human impact on the world for almost the whole night. Not to forget about the combination with my first crazy mate-experience. This heavy Argentinian tea should definitely be denominated as a drug haha üòÖüôâ
The next morning we slept in until the early afternoon, but it was definitely worth it and after a quick but great Dip into the ice-cold pool on the rooftop of the building under the sun and fresh air on top of B.A., I was completely awake again and ready to cook some Breakkie (at almost 5pm :D :D ).

I am very thankful to have been hosted by Alex and which him all the best for his future!

I really really wish they had stayed more so i could show them more places that tourists usually don't get to see in Athens! Artem and Oksana, I'm so glad I met you, you are so very welcome anytime here again and I really hope I will make it to Kiev one day! (I really want to meet your little kids actually, I'm sure they will be fun to be around :)) Keep travelling! Gia mas!

A little after 2am he sends me a message that he's now walking towards my place. 03:10 he arrives in front of my house.

His reason for being late was that he was helping a drunk (foreign?) girl get home. Now I'm not saying this isn't a valid reason. The biggest issue here is he failed to communicate his major delay to me. I didn't hear anything of Roman between ~2am and ~3am. I had to stay up to wait for him so I can let him in from the cold.

I wish you both a great journey and adventure wherever you go. All the best.

Although something always got in the way, whenever we wanted to have a tour together, her advice and commentary really shaped my experience of the city.

I also spent some time with her friends and students and enjoyed learning Dixit with them.
