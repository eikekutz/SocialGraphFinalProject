However they did some things that weren’t really in the the Couchsurfing spirit:

* they were late -informing they’d be 50min late at the point when they should have arrived and then were 1.5h late.

* we went shopping and made dinner - they didn’t offer to contribute for the groceries.

* they had said they’d stay Wednesday to Friday, but were actually planning to stay Wednesday And Friday- which however backfired since I couldn’t host in such a manner.

* I made them breakfast and they added an own separate dish to that - which they didn’t offer even though we were all eating together and I’ve given them proper breakfast.

Мария - прекрасный собеседник. Она любознательна и наблюдательна, знает многое о жизни. У нее практическое мышление, она умеет давать дает точные и развернутые ответы. Она может рассказать о теории автостопа так, что вы будете готовы ехать прямо сейчас. Также у нас обнаружились общие интересы в области музыки. Я был рад сходить с ней на симфонический концерт в Харькове, я не ожидал, что у нас могут совпасть интересы в этой области, поэтому был действительно удивлен и обрадован. Что еще я могу сказать о Марии? Она умна, оптимистична, гостеприимна, тактична, но при этом с ней можно говорить обо всем и не чувствовать дискомфорта из-за табуированной в обществе темы. Меня до сих пор поражает, что Мария путешествует автостопом в одиночестве на огромные расстояния и чувствует себя при этом совершенно комфортно. Мне кажется, для этого нужно иметь особенное видение мира.

 We had an amazing stay at his place. He has two dogs, and a cat who are all adorable and friendly.
 If you love animals his house will be a paradise for you. He also prepared us a fantastic dinner. The next day after we had breakfast, we went for a walk with the dogs to the nearby lakes. It was wonderful!
We are very thankful to Oleg, he provided us with everything we needed and he made us feel wellcomed. We hope to see him again soon. :)

It was my first couchsurfing experience as a surfer and i was in a country that i couldn't even read the alphabeth, also cause of i was travelling alone, I was worried about my travel. 
When i sent her a msg on CS, she told that she will be out of country but her boyfriend can help me. She was really thoughtful kind and caring me eventhough we didn't meet. I think, that is an amazing generous soul. 

Her boyfriend, Anton is also awesome btw, he guided me in city(not only knows but also loves  a lot about culture, history, architecture, food...). He brought me to many beautiful places where was impossible to find as a tourist. He answered all my questions eventhough they were stupid smtimes.
