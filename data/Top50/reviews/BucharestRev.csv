Bucuresti is a big and complex place, you need someone like Vlad and Alexandra to help you around.

Thanks to Vlad, I've got to see a lot of Bucharest and to make some of my dreams come true, like visiting the National History Museum, visiting Carturesti Carusel Bookshop, visiting Stavropoleos Church, drinking a fresh cold beer at Manuc and many others. Thanks Vlad for making the most out of Bucuresti for me and taking me with you to the Black Sea :)
Thanks to Alexandra I had very good meals and a lot of laughs because she is superfunny :))) Thanks for taking care of me :)
I met Vlad and Alexandra a few months ago when I hosted them at our place in Timisoara, we also had a lot of fun then and the deal was to do my best with planning to come to Bucuresti and so I did :)))

Have fun in Iran! Alex, be careful not to get too fond of the hijab there! :P
Vlad, make sure you wont make longer tours than the one you did for me! That is my badge, I want it to remain like that! :P

You are always welcome to our place and I am sure we will meet some time soon!

22965385,"I visited Romania for the first time in May and this was the first time I used Couchsurfing as well. I had not used it before and to use it was one of the best decisions I had made. I was travelling solo and did not know much about the country.This wonderful couple, Alexandra and Vlad Dicianu hosted me for 5 days and 4 nights. Meeting Alexandra was a memorable experience. She made my stay in Romania so convenient . I tasted lovely Romanian food with them. She ensured that I had the best cuisines of Romania. She made drinks for me that I had never tasted and even made sure that she had something for me during out road trip.My stay was wonderful because of the efforts she put into it.A truly remarkable woman and a true Couchsurfer by heart. Vlad is a fun loving, always smiling, never say no attitude and nicest guy I have met in a while. He took me for a road trip where we covered 1500 km in 3 days. Had it not been for both Alex and Vlad, I would not have seen the places I ended up visiting. Vlad had promised me that since it is my first Couchsurfing experience, he will make sure that its a memorable one and he delivered his promise. In the 5 days I was there, he spent all the time to show me around and tell me about his beautiful country.
It was my first experience with Couchsurfing and because of the memorable experience this couple gave me, I am going to use it more. I understood how it is like to give back to the community. Both Alex and Vlad are gem of a person and I would recommend every couch surfer to request them for a stay if possible. These 5 days were the best experience of my travelling experience and I have grateful to them for making it that way.
Thank you guys so much.

I would've known hers too had it not been for my incredibly shitty memory and mushed up brain. I was supposed to do loads of work and we both agreed that we'd let me, but we didnt. We went to the best market, cooked soups and pastas, we talked about intimate stuff, I transformed in her best gay friend and we ate all the hummus in the world. Sorry, theres none left. You could try and make some, but we also ate all the chickpeas. Ina's great and I would definitely recommend staying with her.

Dmitri, after his office hours met with me at old center and walked over some parks and principal interest points around the city during all afternoon. After that, we met Olea and took a walk in the VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Mature Park.

They are very thoughtful and helpful people, and gave me a comfortable and quiet place to sleep, very good food, the possibility to take a shower, and some indications and tips for public transportation to reach my next destination.

Before BWC Mihai had asked me to host hi. I couldn't confirm directly and when I did he had already found somebody else.
...but like it happens so often during WinterCamp, guests have different plans than their hosts and so finally Mihai ended up surfing two nights at my place.
I am really happy that things turned out in that way cause I have already taken him in my heart.
Mihai has a postivie approach to strangers, is helping out when a helping hand is needed, has good sense of humour can party like hell and is worth to listen to as he has amazing stories to tell.
Thanks for an amazing time and a special big thank you for saving our party and being our DJ for three nights.

It was awesome to meet someone from whom I could learn so much. It doesn‚Äôt happen very often when you‚Äôre travelling, to you meet someone who is interested in a complete different aspect and perspective of your travels and just life in general. 

We had such interesting conversations with Mihail, conversations I will remember for a long time, that it is really sad we could only stay with him for one night. He has done so much, has such an incredible diversity to himself, there is honestly YEARS of conversation and topics to be discussed. 

I feel incredibly lucky to have crossed paths with Mihail, to have met such a kind, amazing, loving and inspiring person.

1) He cooks amazing French fries (better than anyone north Americans)
2) He will impress you with his football and guitar skills

(Although we had to say goodbye the evening before their departure, they left soooo quietly in the morning that me and Joris didn‚Äôt even wake up, amazeballs).

The thing that makes him a great surfer for every kind of host, is his autonomy. He‚Äôs so considerable for and adaptive to the host‚Äôs personal schedule, and will surely find a way to amuse himself. As a host I can definitely recommend spending time and exploring the city together with Alex, but if you won‚Äôt be able to do that, it‚Äôs safe to say he won‚Äôt blame you one bit.

Alina has great home and kitchen near the center . Things are kept in order and I find it very systematic. 

Alina's brother Cip took me to old town to clubs and we partied whole night there like crazy. We also cooked some food, drank tea and palinca. I felt like home and I am now one Cimpoeru deep down at heart :)

Overall I had stayed few extra days coz my hosts were just warm and loving. I recommend them for couch surfing with positive reviews.

We had a great evening with them, together with our other new couchsurfing friends Razvan & Andra. When we found out that we unfortunately would have to leave our other couchsurfing host early the next morning, due to them going away on short notice, Adrian and Micky spontaneously offered to bring us with them home and host us after all. 
One of the highlight of our Bucharest trip was definitely the entertaining stories told by Adrian, but also the little local market that we went to in their village. The short, but lovely meeting ended with them driving us back into town. Thanks guys, we would love to meet again.

However, I cannot say that I felt comfortable staying with him.

I didn't like his attitude towards women, sometimes criticising, sometimes idealising, but insistently talking about them to the extent of making me felt uncomfortable.
Along the same line, on the walls he had photos of a few female couchsurfers he had met, what I found a little excessive.

That was my experience. And just MY experience, but I think that some other people, specially women, could feel the same way.
