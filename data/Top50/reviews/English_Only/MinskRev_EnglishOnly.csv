I don't want to describe their trip in Morocco because I'm afraid to miss something, but you can ask them how was it, they have a lot to tell you.

Thank you so very much for everything!

Natasha hosted us for 4 days during the New Year holidays: from 31 December to 3 January. She was kind enough to do so, even though our request was very short notice! 

She drove us from another place where we stayed the previous night to her house, which came in very handy: we had some heavy luggage.

At first, we thought we'd be staying with her and her wonderful family. You can imagine our amazement when we learnt that she was leaving the whole apartment at our disposal, along with her beautiful cat!! That was like a gift from above:  we were all alone in this apartment with a big kitchen (I love kitchens!), keeping an eye on the cat (I love cats!), and seeing the New Year in. Amazing!

Then, when she returned, she arranged for us to stay with her friend for 2 nights, who happened to live in a neighbouring house.

All this is just like Natasha: she is very kind, thoughtful, and attentive. We had some wonderful discussions about our profession and life in general with both Natasha and her husband, Sergey.

I wish we had more time for communication, though. I do hope we meet again, soon! 
Natasha, Sergey, Alyosha: you are most welcome to our place!

The next day, Oskar came home with tons of fresh local veggies from his father's farm and we all cooked a lovely vegetarian dinner together. Oskar took me to the Khatyn Memorial, a tribute to almost three million Belarusians who died during World War 2. It was an emotional and educating experience. We all had some great cocktails at Oskar's bar. He is a great cook and bartender.

I admittedly wasn‚Äôt in a very great mood when I arrived, yet Nurzhan was very understanding and did everything he could to cheer me up. He picked me up from the bus station, showed me around town, helped me out to get some stuff sorted out and was very respectful towards a change of plans that I had coming up. I had a great time and Nurzhan did everything he could to make my stay unforgettable.
He is probably the most understanding, generous and helpful person I‚Äôve ever met. Also incredibly open-minded, adventurous and intelligent. I couldn‚Äôt have been any luckier to get the chance to stay with Nurzhan.
So if you ever get the chance to host or stay with him, you should absolutely consider yourself lucky, because this guy is just overall an amazing person; You DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt regret it!

I stayed for 1 night at Valentine‚Äôs place and I had a great CS experience with him during 2 days. We walked a lot!  So I had great opportunity to expand knowledge about Minsk and about life in Belarus. He is passionate about architecture and Minsk. He developed a plan to see major city-sights in short time. Thanks for that! 
Over walks&conversations with this intelligent person definitely widen my horizons and made me want to come back for longer chats.¬†He presented me another Minsk, seriously I thought that Minsk is the city without youngsters‚Äô energy and nightlife. I liked Minsk so much and I will definitely come back. 
Valentine is very friendly and polite person. He really cares about his surfers and always offers them the best. I slept on his bed with a nice and warm blanket and clean linens. 
Moreover Valentine has adorable cat. They‚Äôre in love. You will feel it. üòâ

She is very polite, smart and always in a good mood (her smile can be contagious!); moreover she has many interesting stories and experiences to share. We had very good moments together eating typical Italian food, tasting wine from Tuscany and going out to see the marvelous architecture and city landscapes of Florence. And, of course, we have also had many occasions to laugh!
Be careful: it's almost impossible to avoid falling in love with her, you should trust me about this :)
Yuliya, thanks so much for the time spent together.

1271,18525090,"I was hosted by Yuliya during my first night in Minsk where I came this autumn to attend in a volunteer workcamp. I feel so blessed by meeting this amazing person. When I saw Yuliya's profile for a first time I had this warm feeling that she is a special person and my possible stay with her might be an extraordinary experience. And I wasn't wrong at all!

First of all Yuliya is very caring person who is interested only in having honest and deep relations with people. During our evening and morning talks we were speaking a lot about our feelings, emotions, good and bad life experiences and about our inner worlds. Not with everyone you can have such a conversations! I was and still I am very touched by this. I discovered that we're very similar to each other and I've started to think that we're twin souls from two neighbouring countries. I hope for the future we can make this friendship growing =).

Yuliya is pure kindness. She picked me up from the station and helped me to arrange the meeting with organizers with my workcamp (actually she did it all). She arranged fro us the meeting with her friend Alena and we went to the wonderful cafe with the view to the ""city gate of Minsk"" I was amazed by. And as a cherry of the top of a cake she prepared a delicious vegan pumpkin pancakes for our breakfast. Dear Yuliya, I appreciate all You have done to me and I can't wait you visit me in Poland. I miss You already very much. You are surely one of the best people I have ever met. Please, keep dreaming and keep growing. Keep discovering yourself in this big and fascinating world. I hope that we can make this trip to Ireland we were speaking about come true =)!

Warm hugs from cold Poland!

Even though I changed my schedule several times, bought bus ticket to Minsk in the last minute and arrived very late in the city.

He adjusted his schedule to be available to guide me in the city! He‚Äôs very knowledgeable. I considered myself lucky to have this opportunity to know the history of the country from his point of view.

He lives at his parents‚Äô apt which is clean, comfortable, next to the bus terminal and metro stations. The location is totally convenient.

I told him... He was an angel in my life!

I don‚Äôt have words to express my gratitude to him! 

Thank you Vadim for taking care of me, for being available to show the city, for preparing a delicious breakfast, dinner and for being patient!

Sergej lives a bit far outskirts of the city, but when you sleep at night you hear nothing but silence.
He lives in a clean flat with his sister, 2 cars and one dog.
I felt very welcome, and Sergej knew a lot of things about the city.
How to reach the places with the bus or by metro. 
Talking about it.
When you take bus 27 from the back side of the railway station you need about 30 minutes to reach the bus stop. 
From there you walk about 0.7 miles or 10 minutes straight to his place. 
If you prefer the metro it about 30 minutes on foot from piatrouscyna station.
A big mall is not far from there. 
Sergei has trusted me a lot by leaving me his keys while he went away for about 4 days in his flat.
The fridge was stuffed with delicious, self-made food and even has an unstoppable stock of tea. 
I would always come to his place again.

Kiril is a globetrotter! A free-thinker! A workaholic! And a even bigger partyholic! :D :D He walks about like an inquisitive child, always hungry for more. Learning from his inquisitiveness and teaching others from it! He's like Timothy Olyphant from the Hitman movie. He's notices thing which are oblivious to us common folks. Like the dangerously *cough*illegal*cough* extensions of the Soviet era apartment or say the placement of a Gas valve next to combustible materials. I wouldn't be surprised if he went on to build a ""Time Machine!!!"" This guy is that good!
It's a pleasure to stroll the city with him. Even if you had walked down a alley a thousand times, I bet he'd notice something you have not before.
So, I say to all you folks who are thinking of hosting him; Don't think! Open up your doors, cuz you're in for ""The Amazing Kiril experience!""

She not only hosted me but was also very generous with her time (of course after work). She also prepared breakfasts for me. Basically she provides 5 star service. 

She lives close to the city center, together with her roommate (who i have not seen, she was gone during my stay) and a cat. Generally i am not a pet lover but the whole experience was so good that eventually i ended up liking even Tomatik (dasha's cat). 

Dasha also introduced me to real rhythm of jazz and she also inspired me to do a very exitic trip in cinque terre. 

And one more thing, Dasha registered on this website long time ago but nevertheless she is relatively new to couchsurfing. She just recently started using it. 

Thank you Dasha for everything and i am sure we will meet each other one day again!
