In addition to this incident, I think there was much miscommunication despite his efforts to create welcoming gestures (walk in the neighborhood, trips to markets, homemade expresso).

I simply felt the couchsurfing experience was awkward and had to trust my intuition. I had brought gifts and treated my host to dinner but every outing proved to me that he was incredibly introverted. I am appreciative for his time and space as I stayed five out of my eight requested days. However, I suggest that he should set a list of expectations and boundaries, as a result from my stay, I hold the perception that he wanted specific female company.

The Saturday night Maurizio spent with me in the club and it was a marvelous time. It is been a long time I have not got such a pleasure dancing on the house music they played there!!! And that ""early breakfast"" after the club in a non-touristic pizza place was sooo delicious.

So Roberto and I started chatting a few months before I stayed, and he helped me so much along the way, giving advice about locations, hotels and my itinerary (for cities even outside of Rome). He even took time out of his life to help me book all of my train tickets for my 2 weeks in Italy!!!

His place is spotless, large, so nicely decorated, and welcoming! I even got to be in his guest bedroom and not a ""couch"" .  Guest bedroom is so clean, and COMFORTABLE, even though I was on vacation I did not want to leave that room. 

He offered delicious snacks and made sure I was comfortable every moment of our time together. He is such a gentleman, so real, and definitely now a friend for life. One thing though, he promised me wine, and I never got it! HA HAAAAAA :D Which now actually gives me a reason to go back one day and be hosted again so its not so bad.

Nothing is a problem for him.  My flight was extremely late - no problem for him - I was feeling absolutely embarrassed to accept to go to his house so late - no problem at all for Roberto he came and collected me in the airport.
As soon as I entered his dwelling he did not know what to do to keep me comfortable and welcomed.  Although we arrived  so late still he wanted to prepare me something for eating.  Afer insisting so much I requested one toast oh my good he offered everything that you can possibly think about - his generosity should be stressed.
Thank you for everything you have done for me: Roberto  collected me in the airport and returned me to the airport. I never accepted this from any of my hosts, but with Roberto, you can never say no don't do it - he is an amazing creature.

We ended up talking all night long about our lifes, projects and dreams and it was a treat. He's a passionate guy, creative, easy going, open minded, funny, easy to talk to, ready to hang out with you and take you to meet his funny friends for beers and pizzas enjoying the local night life, but also totally aware and respectful of your own space and independence. He's the sweetest person and a keen traveller himself, so you can talk for hours with him about countries you've both visited and it will be a blast. I felt absolutely safe with him from the very first moment -even from before meeting him, when we talked through Whatsapp- and it only took a couple of hours to feel I was with a long time best friend.

Also he didn't show much initiative to help with housekeeping, as we live in a family house and it's not easy to keep things clean all the time with one more person among us. 

But he's not a bad person, not at all, the only thing is that he didn't show much CS spirit, and was more like in a hostel rather than in my house. I have to say I didn't tell him any have-to-do list of things, expecting him to know the least he could do to help maintain the house. Also it wasn't so bad because I was sick and home all the time.

One of the best couchsurfing experience and wonderful to could have time together with him for last stay of my whole trip in 6months!!!!!

How he is calm, generous and took care of me soooo much!!!

i believe that we could have a really great time in Tivoli and walking around the park, each time he cooked for me pasta for dinner was soooo amazing!!!!

He is so curious and keen to know the person well.
His attitude is not as the host, as the friend from the beggining.
I feel so happy about it!!

I'm so appreciate for everything!!!
He always tried to me to be comfortable, to showing culture, history, thinking, people in Italy.
We talked a lot in these 3days!!!
He gave me a lot of great gifts of human being with warm-hearted!!!!!

If you have a chance to see him, just don't miss it!

I am glad that we have decided to hitchhike together eventually. Eventhough he was a lit bit worried about HH at the beginning; he turned out to be the most hardcore traveller that i had ever seen. While we shared similar ideas about ""drugs""; i still was drinking and smoking whenever it is available for free; while he never drunk a single beer or a little cigarette. That was something that really suprised me and which made me feel like a little kid near him and i really learned from him a lot. I think nothing can ever stop him from travelling, He can adapt the harshest situations on his way to the pea. He is also quite picky about food. :) The very only Mediterrian that i know who doesn't eat tomatoes!
I really hope to see him again, and i am sure i will!:)

He was just very generous and empathic with me!! That's why I can say that Enrico is very unique in all Rome! I'm really glad I could meet him and for sure if you have the opportunity to meet him, you will find a very reponsible, kind, generous, hard-working, warm and very great person! In the last day I could meet - thanks to him- another CSer from USA who I got very great friendship with! And I think it was a really great experience to share a day with another traveler because It was way fun!

Enrico, Thank you so much for being there when I really needed it!

He offered me some advice for the city, we ate at a nearby restaurant for dinner the 1st night and I cooked dinner for the 2nd.

In the interest of complete honesty, I'd like to say that Enrico was not very talkative during my stay and at times I felt a little uncomfortable. I was also offered help to shower, which I found somewhat unsettling even if it were a joke. After I laughed it off, Enrico seemed alot less enthusiastic about my stay and I felt like this unfortunately lasted through the second night. 

Perhaps I arrived at a bad time for Enrico, as my experience seems to contradict most previous references (except a few who seem to have had similar thoughts) - but all my other CS experiences have been a world apart.

Thanks Enrico for hosting and I hope you understand my thoughts.

A couple things to note, not negative but maybe others before or after me may have also noticed. Enrico was very nice and talkative in the beginning and did flirt/became friendly (I.e. Touchy) but after I told him I wasn't interested in those things he became distant. I tried to talk to him but not much came out.

I didn't know if I was expected to spend all my time with my host and was a bit puzzled at how CS portrayed itself to be a non-transactional platform, surely they expect something in return? I worried about being troublesome and booked a hostel when I reached Rome instead. 

We still met up on the day I was meant to ""check-in"" and it turned out to be a really nice time :) Sirio took me walking around Rome until the wee hours even though I think he was already getting tired (oops) and I felt really lucky to be able to see some wonderful sights in Rome minus the crowds. This also included stopping for delicious original Italian gelato!! I felt safe with Sirio and he agreed to accept me once again as a guest haha, and hosted me for a few days until I left for Florence.

Sirio is a sarcastic and funny person to be around; I initially had a few misconceptions about him :D He looks like some Italian singers so if you don't get to meet them, he's your next best choice. I'm not sure how detailed a CS review is supposed to be but anyway if this had a title maybe I would put ""Comfortable stay, would stay again + bonus pet cat"". The real reason I enjoyed my time with Sirio was actually hanging out with his adorable step cat, Sunny. Just kidding, partly :)

Staying with a Davide in his professional recording studio and watching his fundamentaly different way of living (and doing things in general) truly is a PRIVILEGE. Davide who only eats fruits (and potatoes when he gets sad :) ) has been in a working rush nearly all the time (one band recording was always switched by another) and even though he always found a time to share something with us, introduced us to all the people at the studio, cooked us a delicious meal and the phrase""make yourself at home"" for the first time in my life was NOT just a phrase. For me this was the first couchsurfing experience and I can't imagine how better it could be. It's very uneasy to express our gratitude for how great it was.

Gianluca also gave us a little sightseeing tour with his car and thanks to him, we  found out about so many cool places to eat and drink and party.

In 3 hours at 7.00 a.m. he waked me up and told that I must go away and find another place to stay because he just knew he had to go to the business trip the same day. I went away.

It's not so easy to believe that in 3 night hours person may get know that he had to go to the business trip. But I think that's logical decision if female guests refuse to share her bed with host.

I wouldn't stay with him again tho because I didn't feel safe sleeping in a house/apartment by myself.

Firstly, he knows the map of the sity by heart. He can help with planning your trip in details. Where to go, what to see, which food to try.

Secondly, he is really passionate about his home-country so he can give you a full understanding of what's going on in Syria and in Middle East - one of the most problematic region of the whole world.

Thirdly, he is really deep in Italian culture so he can teach you how to cook a real Italian food (I couldn't forget the taste of carbonara that we made together) and tell you a lot about real Italian life.

We started to get in contact with Allesandro one month before my arrival to Rome and he was going to host me for two days in Rome which were 28.th and 29.th of June and these days are kind of fest called The festival of St Peter and Paul.

But one day before my arrival to Rome, he said I have a pop-up holiday plan with friends and I will not host you and when I see this short mesagge I was in shock because when I arrived Rome, all hotels and hostels were nearly full...

I found a hostel room to stay with a lot of difficulties which costed me for two nights: €70.

My suggestion for the people who are planning to stay at his place:
Be aware of that, you can face with a situation like me, so don't be trustworthy to him, if he offers you to stay at this house.

We also hung out in the evening in his special neighborhood, which is much better than the crowded places in the city center (but still not far from there, I was walking to the center easily).

Lorenzo is a really spontaneous and fun guy. As Vanessa said, we were really luck to have him as host from a couch emergency reply. He loves art too, he can make a good pasta in one minute, and I'm sure he is really elegant with any jacket, girls. :)
I was in the middle of a art documentary fight between him and Vanessa with many art history writers names.. It was really fun and I learned a lot.
And we definetly have to go back to see the last church with Caravaggio's work in Rome!
He took us to a carnival party in the streets of a city next to Rome with a full CS bus too... It even had brasilian music mixed! We danced a lot! Well.. till the cold appears again..
He even saved us with a ride to the airport!
And if you go to Rio I ll be really mad at you if you choose another host. (Well, unless if it is Vanessa's place)

Tommaso let me stay at his place even though he had to leave for a day. This kind of trust touches me deeply, and I couldn't be grateful more.

This place is definitely one of the most unusual places I used to stay — a minihouse with a minigarden in a middle of ordinary city block. It's incredibly cosy and immediately makes you feel at home. 

Thanks for showing me the market and helping with cheeses. My family is quite happy with them :) And also thanks for taking me to your Kino and showing this side of Rome. I wish you to find a great winter place for it and prosper!

I doubt I could successfully leave the city at night without your help. I reached home at time mostly because of your advices. Thanks!

It's sad a little bit that we didn't have much time to spend together, I really enjoyed your society, sarcastic sence of humour and meals. I'd be glad to meet you again, so let me know if you finally would go to St.-P.

Ermes is a super funny, energetic and smiling guy, with a touch of madness which would surprise and entertain you. He had always good ideas to make my stay special: we hung around the city and discovered pubs, once we went to the sea having the first swim of the season and he tried to teach me how to play guitar. Moreover, he has a pretty flexible schedule, so, when he was studying at home, I could visit Rome following my ""touristic schedule"" without any pressure. He also introduced me his friends and we spent time all together.
The house is very nice, an appartment in a pretty neighborhood in the north-east of the city, next to the metro and bus stations and near a suggestive neighborhood called Coppedé.
