Very good English.
In conversation with a foreigner, all his personality traits multiply :-) Plus, he will tell you a word, the English translation of which you forgot, which helps a lot when you forget it during the conversation :-)

It's was always interesting to hangout with Denis. For example, we rode bicycles around the neighborhood in which Denis and Anya (his beautiful wife) live. It was amazing :-) Basically, this is a forest with paths, plus an original, but very harmonious architecture of the infrastructure of the Academgorodok. This fun family did not let me get tired or somehow strain myself :-) During all the time of our communication I got (and I hope that I also shared :-) a lot of positive emotions! Our last hangout was incredible! XD

Summary: excellent sense of humor in the sum with a positive attitude :-)

She took me a Rock concert to see her friend's playing and was so nice. Also she cooked for us and tried to help me as much as she could.
I on my heart hope to meet her again someday, somewhere in the road.

Ademas, ella es una gran viajera de moto cicleta asi que cuando nosotros hablabamos sobre nuestro viaje, lo era siempre interesante y bueno. 
Ella me llevo a un concierto para ver su amigos tocando la musica y lo fue que genial. Y ella cocin√≥ la comida para nos, intentaba ayudarme hasta ella puede hacer maximo.
Algun dia, algun lugar yo espero de encontrar ella en el camino por mi corazon.
