To start off, he picked us up at the airport and drop us off as well, which there was no need at all, specially because it was very late arriving and very early departing.
Besides that, he arranged a multi-cultural dinner with his flatmates so ended up an amazing moment where we laughed a lot, exchanged a lot of curiosities of each ones' nationality, and got to try different and tasty food! 
He has also another CS guest the same day, and was still managing everything. 
There's no need to detail everything we did within a short period, but the point is that Sylvain is an amazing guy, a super dad and sees people and everything in such a positive way that if everyone had a bit of his positivity, the world would be a better place.

Since we'd been texting over the Internet for more than a year when I realised I was going to Madrid there was no doubt who I'd message about an available couch. And I've never regretted it. Pablo hosted me and a friend of mine for about 5 nights in February with a short break in between when we went to Germany. He was also too kind to pick us up from the airport and then take us back there in the middle of a Saturday night!
Pablo is an amazing host who lives in an amazing place with an amazing dog. Everything that CS asks for when you provide a reference is there: he is an incredibly friendly, thoughtful and knowledgeable person. I would never have learned the fantastic things I've learned about Spain if I hadn't stayed with Pablo. I enjoyed every moment of my stay with him. He is so easy and interesting to talk to that I literally couldn't see how the sands of time were running out.
He's also extremely funny, so, get the chance and, please, ask him to tell you what ""Tres metros sobre el cielo"" is about! Or just ask to parody some accents!
Don't miss out the opportunity of meeting such a cool person and send him a request immediately or accept his if he's asking for a couch!

Nuno did not just host me; he wholeheartedly assisted me in a series of unfortunate events that befell me during my visit to Madrid. Besides being always willing to help, he tried to cheer me up and took me out for a coffee then a nice lunch party with his equally nice and good-hearted friends. He permitted me access to all utilties of his comfortable and clean flat and trusted me with its keys, and that made it much easier for me to take care of my recurring troubles. Not to forget to mention that I overstayed the agreed period in his flat without him being bothered at all. I cannot possibly count the many genuine human qualities I saw in Nuno, I can only be thankful for my misfortunes which led me to meet this wonderful persona. 

Nuno, I'm forever grateful for all that you've done for me. I look forward to meeting you again.

All the best.

He welcomed my friend and I into his home for two nights this week-end, sharing with us his food (even though he was on a strict diet due to an upcoming medical procedure), his advice on things to do in Madrid while he was having lunch with his family on Saturday, and his time by taking us out for drinks and tapas on Saturday night and spending the Sunday with us at the flea market in La Latina and the Retiro park. He has traveled a lot and lived abroad even longer, and is very knowledgeable on many topics. He was also kind enough to not judge us too harshly when my friend and I got drunk on the wine and tapas tour, and made sure we did not do anything stupid like chasing after balloons or cross the road when cars were coming! Sorry again for that, Enrique...
As for his flat, it is very nicely located, not so close to the tourist attractions that you get disturbed by the noise, but it is also only a 15 minute metro ride away from the center of Madrid. There is also a direct bus from his place to the center which takes a little longer but is a nice way to see some landmark buildings from the comfort of a warm seat, which is what we did on Enrique's advice! And if you are into football he lives super close to the Real Madrid stadium. The sleeping arrangement is great also, Enrique has a sofa-cama that can easily fit two people (I have quite a bit of fat and could still fit with my friend). His living space is very uncluttered, which is awesome in a city like Madrid where things go 200 km/hour, and he has the coolest book shelves on earth!

He was partying like a real disco expert: when we were already dead, he was still dancing...this guy is unbelievable! 
I think I can say that we have found a new friend, who really is a lovely and caring person! We are really grateful that he had us at his home and make our trip unforgettable, thanks again!!

He was very helpful with everything and made me feel at home while in Madrid. It was overwhelming as he also came all the way till the bus station to guide me with my bus. 

I would definitely like to go again in future and yes Jose, hope you have great fun during your India trip, never hesitate to ask for any help you need.

She spontaneously drove us to Toledo where we enjoyed the beautiful view from the mountains. I felt most welcome and Rosaana is an easy talker. Thanks for everything and till next time!

We stayed with Rosana for 3 nights me and my friend Sophia........and we where really impressed at how clean and organised her flat was. We also loved her little dog (I think her name is Grace), she is so sweet, unusually she is quiet, does not bark or make noise like you would expect from a small dog. They are usually very loud and noise, but she was really sweet/cool and just wanted to cuddle with me on the sofa.

Rosana picked me up from the station with her lovely pink car, which i thought was very sweet and kind of her to do. We got on well straight from the beginning even though she struggled to speak in English but mostly because she wasn't confident but she is really good in English.

So Im definitely recommending staying with Rosana or just meeting up with her for a coffee/drink, you will definitely i have a great time with her.

Rosana thank you for an amazing time in Parla, i really enjoyed staying with you I'm only sorry that the time was short but we definitely gonna keep in touch.

863,26870858,"What can I say about Jose... Written language simply isn't enough to describe this inspiring, kind, and cheerful soul. Jose welcomed me in on very short notice and made me feel so very welcome in his cozy and warm home. He had a separate room already prepared for me and was willing to wait up for me when I arrived at midnight. Then we chatted over a couple of beers for what only seemed like a few minutes but was actually an hour.  Without even trying, Jose makes you feel like you've been longtime friends or a pen pal you've had since middle school and now you finally meet. And just look at the date he joined CS and look at how many references and friends he has had in such a short time. Don't just take my word for it, go meet him. Enjoy a beer and make a lifelong friend.

He gave me a walking tour of Madrid for 5 hours and showed me tons of sights when I arrived in the city. The next day, we went to a museum together and he showed me even more of Madrid. He was also very patient with my imperfect Spanish (we did speak Spanish for 11 hours though, so it's not that imperfect!), and our conversations gave me confidence to speak Spanish more in Spain. I truly gained a new friend in Jos√© and I appreciate the relationship we built in such a short time. If you have the opportunity to visit Madrid, stay with Jos√© - but do yourself a favor and get to know him; if you don't, you'll miss out on one of the best interactions and experiences of your life.

I had some work meetings during my stay and he had to work but we could share a lot of things on our free time,  we walked around the city, and he was so nice to take me to Sierra de Guadarrama, where we did a 3-4 hrs trekking, that place is beautiful, and is very special to go into nature with him as he is soooo knowledgeable about flora and fauna; but we also talked about very different topics, he is very open minded and likes very much to share time with his surfers.

I really recommend staying with Antwone or taking him out for a meal or coffee to grow your understanding of purpose of life, how to create, spiritual guidance and great local food joints in Madrid. He's a busy hard working guy but maybe you can catch him in the morning or at night.

Adem√°s, es una persona muy simp√°tica y inteligente, con qui√©n puedes charlar por a√±os y, asimos, tendr√° algo nuevo a aprender. Se te gusta historia, especialmente la romana, Julen es el experto. 
Mas all√° de arque√≥logo, es un gran masajista. Me ha ofrecido una masaje fenomenal, que dej√≥ nuevo despu√©s de tanto estr√©s con las viajes. 
We had a really good time together. A lot of fun, mixed with jokes and serious talks, resulting in the best experience I could get in my last week in Europe.
Gracias por todo amigo, sepa que lo pase muy bien.

Julen is one of those couchsurfing hosts that restores your faith in what it means to be a couchsurfer--to be moved by the kindness of strangers and the ability, even across different languages and cultures, to find friendship in the most foreign of places. He welcomes you into his home not only as his guest, but as his family and the experience is a wonderful one. Patient, intelligent, comic and hospitable to an all new level. 

Not to mention the fact that Julen is a charmer, the suavist of the suave, the most poignant of the passionate, with eyes and eyebrows that could take down wildebeasts. How any lady could resist him, I'm not sure. 

Quatro cien por ciento de una experiencia increiblemente chevere! Esto hombre es un hombre entre ninos, un montana entre colinitas, el guapissomo, el elegantissimo, el siete maravillas de mundo en una lugar.

if you understand spanish you will probably laugh a lot since he have a very special sense of humor.

He is a photographer, like  me, and he is not only easy going, smart and can go totally independent in a foreign city but:
- I learned cooking from him (now I can make tortilla de patatas almost as good as his), and:
- he corrects my Spanish. I learned a lot from him. But more than that:
- he showed me stuff that I had never heard of - in MY OWN CITY! A Spanish guy who lives in Poland(!) showed me a great place, the train cemetery - only a few kms from my house.  We sneaked in and took some great photos. We had the perfect weather and perfect shots.  (see his profile)

1720,23112381,"This was my first trip to Europe and my first experience in Couchsurfing. Carlos made of this experience the best one. All time Carlos went very kindless, thoughtful, careful, and generous with me. I think I was lucky to find him, but a little more lucky when he accepted my request. It has a very nice flat, comfortable, and clean with a tasteful decoration, located in a very strategic area of the city from where it is very easy to reach the downtown, walking a few meters to the station of Laguna. Carlos not only gave me a space in his flat, he also gave me his time to share very fun conversations. He is a very smart guy with whom you can learn a lot about spain culture, reflective themes, and also laugh a lot about other topics while you drink a good glass of wine or while you eat a delicious salmon that he prepared me himself. He allowed me to have the keys to his house during the first two days while I was visiting the beautiful city of Madrid. The last night Carlos accompanied me to walk through the magical Gran Via, the Plaza Mayor and the Mercado de San Miguel, while he told me and explained the history of these places, where we also shared a cold beers and a delicious dinner.
With him I could be who I am and learn a lot. Carlos has a many qualities who make him a great human being. I arrived to Madrid to know this magical city but today I have a great friend,  a brother. I will never have enough words to say thank you for this great experience. I just hope to hang out with him again in the future. I'm wait for you in Colombia, my brother.

sorry that I didnt have the time to leave you a reference since march, I had so many other things in my mind that I found it hard to think back to my time in madrid.

I surfed with Jesus for a whole Weekend to participate in a Magic: The Gathering (a famous card game) tournament. Since I lost on the first day, I had the time to get to know Jesus a little more (I planned to play the whole weekend). We ate Tapas in two of his favourite places in Madrid, and I much enjoyed it. It was a little hard at first to communicate, since there was a little language barrier, but soon we understood each other. The chemisty was just right. After a few beers, we were talking about deep topics, like family and the very personal view on the own future.

I very much recommend you to stay with jesus. He showed me an awesome angry birds costume he bought from the internet, i suppose you may see it anywhere dancing around soon.

He is a gentleman who will always help you and support with anything you need but also will take you to parties and show you the beauty of his city. He is an experienced traveller and has sooo many interesting stories to share! 
I really like his sense of humour and admire how brave and strong he is. He started his career from scratch and succeeded because of his brilliant ideas and hard-working. Even while being a boss he is a friend for his co-workers and a person with who they can share any problem. His strategies are modern and innovative. He is a very inspirational person, indeed.

Eduardo went far beyond in making sure we were comfortable, he was very attentive (he even made us paella one day ). We honestly felt like we are at home.

Personally,I will stay with him again.

But some reminders for surfers:

First of all He doesn‚Äôt speak English ,  we use google translate for very simple conversations, and after that , we always sit in silence but it‚Äôs totally fine .if you speaks Spanish I think you will get a better conversation with him .

Secondly,the room will be always dark because he is frugal, doesn‚Äôt wanna use any  unnecessary  electricity such as light üí°. he didn‚Äôt say anything about the usage of water but I feel like using water cautiously.

Last but not least , he sleep at the sofa and offers the room for guest which is very generous . I appreciated it , I really am . But for girls surfers,  Just imagine a typical guy living alone , how the room will look like . It  might not clean enough for girls.(or maybe for guys too)

Anyway, Fernando is a good guy, you should stay with him if you are really on  budget trips and the location is great.

All the way since we met he has been introducing the buildings and monuments we passed by, and he's really observant taking note to some architectural features I never noticed. We had a light n nice dina and went up to a lounge for a drink and the beautiful night view. I especially liked talking to Vincent as he's very open-minded, and it's inspiring to know about how he lives in Spain as a foreigner.

Although declining my initial request for a couch for three nights, because he had to work, he contacted me the day after I had arrived in Madrid, staying in a hostel, and suggested to meet for a drink in the evening. That we did and within 4 hours of talking and laughing got to know each other well enough that he offered  me to stay the other two nights at his place, trusting me with a key, since he still had to go to work. I am very grateful, Not just for the accommodation in his nice and centrally located apartment, but for his experience and skills he shared with me, who is just a beginning couchsurfer and Spanishspeaker. Javier is quite a teacher of important Spanish phrases, even basic Spanish sign language, He showed me the best architectural Madrid sights with illumniation at night and he is good at performing tricks with his fingers. I certainly had a fun time with him. Muchas Gracias, Javier!

For me it was also really nice to be able to speak in Italian with him (and his funny Italian flatmate Mauro), it made me feel at home and comfortable.

Fernando is one of the reasons why we started liking the city. The time spent with him talking, going out and even having breakfast together will always be bright things to remember.

Next night we went to some performance near his house that was very interesting. We Couldn't stay much because we were tired and had long flight to Ecuador next day. So we left bit early. Thanks a lot for hosting. We enjoyed a lot staying with you but unfortunately we didn't had more time for more interaction. Hope to meet you again soon. Good luck and wish you life full of travels.
