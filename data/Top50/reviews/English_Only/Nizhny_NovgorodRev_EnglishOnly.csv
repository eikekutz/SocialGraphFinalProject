He showed us everything intersting in the city and told us about its history (he will call them ""boring stuff"" but they re not) and taught us a lot about local food.

Another best thing about them is, Fedor and Svetlana - they both love travelling. This means, you'll get to hear many stories from them about their experiences. They shared many of their travelling experiences with me and really incited a spark in me to explore places that they have already been to!
Fedor and Svetlana, both helped me a lot with my itinerary. They guided me to a perfect plan to explore their beautiful city.
They also ensured that my stay was comfortable, and never let me feel as if I was from somewhere else.
Fedor, besides being so knowledgeable about travelling, is a great cook too. He kept checking on me everytime if I was hungry, and made me meals of my preferences! The best part - he cooks great too! :D
Their daughter - Christina is a great host as well. She's kind, sweet and really caring!

Taras is someone very sensitive for the best and a little for the worst. He is very sympathetic, easy going, helpful. He is at the same time a bit rationalist, artist (musician) and sportive men. You could have a lot of good conversations with him sharing some biers. He like to understand others cultures. Despite his youth, he knows many references in old rock n roll and indie musics.  We had an intense connection by listening a song of the Doors. I regret to haven't had the opportunity to ""fly away"" with him a little more. But the destiny is like this. 

When he was at home, he followed the rules, was tidy, respectful, punctual, kept me informed of what is doing when he was outside. You can give him your keys without any problems.  With Julia, they cooked some russian foods that they bought although they didn't have a lot of money and that Taras doesn't like to cook. And at the end, he offered me a russian magnet.

I hope i will meet him in the future, see once again his joy of life, and perhaps be part of one of his hike. ""Born to be wild"". Have the opportunity to hear his ""guitar gently sweeps"". 

See you someday Taras. Keep the mood of the couchsurfer. But be careful sometimes : use protections. Continue to learn how to stay zen, open minded and kind in all situations, with everyone.

While my host was a bit busy with the work schedule, Tanya has shown me the key points of Novgorod and key attractions. We've done a few fun things and sightseeing. Tanya also invited me for a secret shopper visit to a restaurant, which was very nice of her. 

On a personal side, Tanya is flexible, easygoing and fun person with one can talk on different topics. If you visit her in Nizhniy she might invite you to do a few pushups at the river side to check your electrolyte level or drink strong Russian (or maybe not much Russian) puer tea to wake up. Thank you for that experience :)

I can only recommend 100% Tanya as a host, surfer or a travel companion. ",2018-06-16T16:44:53Z,positive,surf,True,1007376008,4255763,Vad,6960884,"Minsk, Minsk Region, Belarus",https://s3.amazonaws.com/ht-images.couchsurfing.com/u/4255763/a2f4ab0b-9463-46a8-9b29-417a8e6f3a45,yes,True,False,,,

665,26144700,"What can I say about this beautiful human being.. Nastia is one of the best persons I met in Russia. Since  the first moment I arrived to her home it seemed like she was just worried about my staying and nothing would have been more important for her than give her guests a comfortable time. This girl is charmingly good for guests I just can‚Äôt believe there are hosts like her.

I stayed 5 days at her apartment and I already miss all the things she did for me. Nastia even cooked food for me and we ate together.. we danced salsa. I was surprise that she was a good dancer so if you like to dance you should deff go out or stay in and have some fun together, anywhere you go with her i am pretty sure you would have a joyful time.

Thank you Anastasiia for having that open and interesting mind, you showed that in the conversations we had together.

I will definitely stay with her again and I will cook Peruvian food for her since I could not do it that time.
