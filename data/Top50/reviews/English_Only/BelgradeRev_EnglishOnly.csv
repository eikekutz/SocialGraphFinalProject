😀 An Amazingly CraZy persona 😄

Let me explain you at first when i send a request she was extremly fast to answer and very dinamyc in the logistics !  She had to wait me all day to arrive cause i didnt reach her and i arrived she was at a friends place roasting peppers but when she found out i arrived, like a FlaSh she ran to host me :) 

Later on we got to know each other a little and she was bold enough to be open and honest about her life in this period. Her paste of living seemed even too speedy for me :) and in this dinamics she doesnt want to spend time on bulshit or hidden things ! So if you meet her be prepared to be naked under your skin ..because thats the only way she will take you serioisly :)

If there should be a definition for a Couchsurfing host she might just be the deffinition of it ! 

Sladjana thnaky for everything and please Love Yourself more than you love beer !

She is very intelligent and got a big knowledge of the world and she would never get tired of conversation ,so feel free to start a conversation with her and you will see how amazing she is .Also she is really interested in Persian culture ,so if you are from Persia ,you will have more chance to be accepted ;)

Slavisa and his family 
ARE AMAZING, the family you rarely meet while travelling

It was a miracle to meet Slavisa, because I was travelling and looking for stage to practice my stand-up comedy, and he happenes to be an former theatre manager, he was so helpful, within one hour, he fixed me up in one gallery for a gig. And it was 5 days later, I only applied for 3 nights, and he kindly allowed to stay until the show was finished. I can never thank them enough.

Slavisa and Slavica and their lovable kids live in the quiet area of Belgrade, their house is located in a cute little forest, you can only never imagine how much I enjoy the forest walk. The buses are frequently to the city. But I really recommend anyone who’s lucky enough to stay there for a day. Enjoy the isolation from the society, hang out with their kids. They are sweet and angelic.

Slavisa and Slavica introduced their theatre friends to me, they are all actresses and actors, fun companies, loads to learn from them. We had one small family gathering, and I tried to cook some Chinese food and perform a bad show for them, hahaha, all of them were so supportive, especially Slavisa, he was always willing to share his stage experience with me, tirelessly taught me how to perform and improve on stage. 

I in fact spent 6 nights at their house due to the performing date, Slavica always made great food for me, took care of me. And Slavisa told me that I should always updated him my stand-up. He is just super nice.

If you are lucky enough to stay with them, you will have a great time in Belgrade.

To be quite honest, he was a breath of fresh air for me because he’s speaks perfect English and previously lived in Florida. He pushed me outside of boundaries and gave me another perspective on life. 

We kept in contact before my arrival in Belgrade so naturally when we met I felt like he was a friend that I was visiting. He picked me up from the bus station and gave me a night tour of Belgrade. I decided to join him on his training regiment on the second day where we biked and swam. The following day we went to Novi Sad to a Aqua Park followed by a tour of the city. Vlad is so knowledgeable about his country that he inspires me to learn more about Florida.

He has a good heart and I’m so happy that he hosted me. Hope to see you again in the future.

I was in Belgrade on an internship, and he showed respect for my late arrivals, and also met me by car.

In my order there was a separate room. In the evenings we had conversations and drank Serbian wine, sitting on the terrace. The view from there is beautiful!

The generosity with food and help, and the room we where put in gave us the feeling that we where old friends of the family, and not CS'ers.
We almost couldn't sit down at the table, without food appearing from the kitchen. We spend a night watching Maja and Marcos (her younger brother) band, and another watching a muppets musical with Maja in it.
One day Maja even drove us around the city and outskirts, showing us all the sites. We had a fantastic time!
