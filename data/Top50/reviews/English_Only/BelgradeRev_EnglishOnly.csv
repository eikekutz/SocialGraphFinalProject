She had to wait me all day to arrive cause i didnt reach her and i arrived she was at a friends place roasting peppers but when she found out i arrived, like a FlaSh she ran to host me :) 

Later on we got to know each other a little and she was bold enough to be open and honest about her life in this period. Her paste of living seemed even too speedy for me :) and in this dinamics she doesnt want to spend time on bulshit or hidden things ! So if you meet her be prepared to be naked under your skin ..because thats the only way she will take you serioisly :)

If there should be a definition for a Couchsurfing host she might just be the deffinition of it !

Slavisa and his family 
ARE AMAZING, the family you rarely meet while travelling

It was a miracle to meet Slavisa, because I was travelling and looking for stage to practice my stand-up comedy, and he happenes to be an former theatre manager, he was so helpful, within one hour, he fixed me up in one gallery for a gig. And it was 5 days later, I only applied for 3 nights, and he kindly allowed to stay until the show was finished. I can never thank them enough.

Slavisa and Slavica and their lovable kids live in the quiet area of Belgrade, their house is located in a cute little forest, you can only never imagine how much I enjoy the forest walk. The buses are frequently to the city. But I really recommend anyone who‚Äôs lucky enough to stay there for a day. Enjoy the isolation from the society, hang out with their kids. They are sweet and angelic.

Slavisa and Slavica introduced their theatre friends to me, they are all actresses and actors, fun companies, loads to learn from them. We had one small family gathering, and I tried to cook some Chinese food and perform a bad show for them, hahaha, all of them were so supportive, especially Slavisa, he was always willing to share his stage experience with me, tirelessly taught me how to perform and improve on stage. 

I in fact spent 6 nights at their house due to the performing date, Slavica always made great food for me, took care of me. And Slavisa told me that I should always updated him my stand-up. He is just super nice.

If you are lucky enough to stay with them, you will have a great time in Belgrade.

He pushed me outside of boundaries and gave me another perspective on life. 

We kept in contact before my arrival in Belgrade so naturally when we met I felt like he was a friend that I was visiting. He picked me up from the bus station and gave me a night tour of Belgrade. I decided to join him on his training regiment on the second day where we biked and swam. The following day we went to Novi Sad to a Aqua Park followed by a tour of the city. Vlad is so knowledgeable about his country that he inspires me to learn more about Florida.

He has a good heart and I‚Äôm so happy that he hosted me. Hope to see you again in the future.

In my order there was a separate room. In the evenings we had conversations and drank Serbian wine, sitting on the terrace. The view from there is beautiful!

She's that kind of person that you can feel really lucky to meet in your life, you know. She has a huge heart, always smiling, in a good moon, definately the person you would like to meet.

We met ourselves occasinally, and after some time hanging out together, also with another guy, she invited me to stay in her place.
To resume how were those days: today is my 15.o day here, and i was planning to spend only two days in Belgrade, so...

I could be here telling a lot of stories, but i think you got the feeling already. In other words, be lucky and stay with her (or accept her, if you're a host haha).
