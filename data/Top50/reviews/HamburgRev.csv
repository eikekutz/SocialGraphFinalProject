27075418,"Haha where should i start describing my experience with Youlin?
OKOK,.. i start with some boring facts:
He crashed my place for one night before he started his trip throgh France back to Germany. Even though I had little expectations towards this short time (and he also described himself as sometimes a little shy), he managed to convince and surprise me of something different right away.

While my ""other"" couchsurfer was still there (Hey Danni :D ), Youlin came to my place and after a little chat, we decided going downtown together.

Youlin is a super smart person and open hearted like no other. He lets you participate in his thinking and openly talks about what is on his mind. At some point it even felt for me like i was experiencing my city through a foreigner's eyes, since he pointed out so many things that i did not see or know and shared his thoughts about and like this gave me a completely new perspective on the already known to me Barcelona. 

But not only on sightseing, but also  in private talks, job topics etc. he was a good talker and listener who knows how to keep up a easy going conversation and atmosphere. I totally am impressed by his lifestyle, kindness and ""think different""-approach.

In the end we went back to my place and continued our talks with some more beers, before we both went to sleep. If there was something i could bitch around about him: Next time stay a day longer. it was way too much fun having you over!

I wish you a safe trip and a lot of nice experiences on your hitchhike through good old france.  I hope to see you again at some point!

18449886,"Wow, being with Paul was really awesome. I was lucky to have him as my host for two nights in Hamburg.
First off, Paul saved me by accepting me as a guest on a really short notice, just two days in advance.
Paul is a very friendly, thoughtful, empathic, open, and intelligent person. He has enourmous travel and life experience, but doesn't push any of his knowledge on you, but rather makes the conversation on any topic interesting and fulfilling. 
He is also a talented artist and I really loved his paintings!
He picked me up at the train station, was there on time notwithstanding my delay. He made a good imression right from the start and things were only going better from then. On our first we decided to stay in as I was a bit tired and we downed a whole 0,7l bottle of Russian Standard just the two of us :D I was fine but Paul had to go to work at 8 a.m. Tell me honestly, what host ever did anything like this for you and went out of his way this much to make you feel at home? ))) 
We had a great two days, went out, paartied, talked about everything, I also met his brother and his friends - all amazing people.
Hope to see you soon Paul, either in Prague or in Hamburg!

They are very pleasant, communicative and friendly persons..
As a guest, they were punctual, clean, helpful and thankful and of course, they respected house rules and me as a host.
I left them the keys of my flat without any hesitation.
During their stay I worked, so they were very independent in sightseeing.
I would definitely recommend the as a guest, and I really home to meet them again.
During their stay, I hosted few more guests and in this way they had proven how tolerant, open ‚Äì minded, modest and flexible they are.
They were great company during the evenings, which we spent together talking and dinners.
They are very easy going and intellectual persons, whom you can speak about any topic. They are also passionate travelers hungry for eyploring other countries and cultures.

We had really nice conversations, she really knows, under my point of view, the meaning of CS.
I really enjoyed with her, she loves every single tip you give her about the places, and you see on her face that she really appreciate  them.
She made me feel comfortable to talk about personal things, which it is not easy with me :P. 
I would say don't doubt about hosting her. She is lovely and has a great heart.

Karsten made breakfast for us three times for my friend and me while we stayed at his place. And not just some normal breakfast, no!

He is a really cool guy and showed us the city during day and night time. His roommate was really nice  and open too. My friend even went to a volleyball tournament with the two of them. 
So to come to an end Karsten is the perfect host, He can show you some very intellectual stuff and also less intellectual stuff like a drinking game (one couldn't say that he lost it, but he didn't win it neither :)

Personally I have to say that our first evening together was the nicest moment of our trip. He took his camera and we went to the little beach in Hamburg at the sunset. The weather was perfect and the light stunning :) He taught me lots of things about my camera and photography. Then, we went to have dinner in an Italian pizzeria and he experienced the Italian (or latin stereotyped way of acting, as the waiters and cooks were Portuguese hahah) with us. The next day, as he had a meeting, we explored the city by ourselves but he recommended us a great Indian restaurant to eat :) At night, we cooked together some Spanish food! I would have liked to have more time and try some of his recipes. I felt like he knows how to cook really nice food. As we were a bit tired we didn‚Äôt go out.
Celia was super happy Finn offered to teach some guitar lessons to Celia, even despite we didn‚Äôt have time for it she really appreciated it. She thanks him for being such a great host! She missed some stuff at his place and he told us as soon as he noticed and he stopped on his way at the train station in order to meet again and give everything to her. It was really kind of him and she always remember such a nice gesture.

We would definitely liked to stay a bit longer ir order to go out at night with him and learn more of all the things that he has to teach!! If you like photography you have to ask him to show you some of his pictures! If you like music, cinema, series,‚Ä¶ he has also lots to tell about.

17073783,"I stayed with Michael 3 nights. 
I have to say that this was my first couchsurfing experience. I never slept before on someones couch. So I had mixed feelings about that. Especially as a girl you are sometimes concerned that the other person could have had second thoughts..
After writing a request on CS he replied in a very nice and decent way that CS sent him my request and that he could host and show me a little bit around after his work. 
So, my first impression on him was that he is a nice, not pushy guy which was the reason why I decided to stay with him. 
And my calm feeling didn't disappoint me, in fact it was quite the opposite. It will not happen very often that someone will impress me with his personality. But exactly that happened when I met Michael.

I arrived with the bus and he picked me up although he had to work. He took my luggage with him into his office and I explored the city since he had to work another 2 hours. We met after his work and went to his apartment where I got my own room, my own keys and got invited to feel like home. Much more that I could have expect. But it was not just that, that made a big impression on me. 
As a social psychologist I am an 'observer'. It is his personality and attitude I am impressed by. From the first time I met him it felt like knowing him for a long time. I appreciate nice, honest, but not boring people, who have interests and passion to share and make you think about stuff. That is how I see Michael. He is a very, very smart and social person with a big heart, who loves to share. He is someone who will always think of others and  doing the right thing. On the other side, he is someone with his own opinion, who will tell you when he is not okay with something. Michael showed me different parts of Hamburg and we had really nice talks. We went in bars but also chilled in his beautiful apartment. 
Because of his smartness without being arrogant I enjoyed every single talk to him. We laughed, had fun, the one or the other drink and just talked about the God and the world. He didn't try to flirt with me or something. So, it was a really comfortable feeling to know that he is nice because it is just his personality. I could write so much more, but I think for now it is enough.
I am still in contact with Michael because I asked him to keep my updated during his big travels, which will start very soon.

Ich bin immer noch auf Wohnungssuche, er bat mir an, dass ich von Montag auf Dienstag bei ihm schlafen kann. Er hat sich sogar extra in der Innenstadt mit mir getroffen. Leider musste Christian am Dienstag schon sehr fr√ºh los und blieb die Woche dann auch weg. Trotzdem durfte (und darf) ich noch weiter bleiben. Die Mutter von Christian meinte, sofern wir uns verstehen und miteinander klarkommen kann ich, bis ich eine Wohnung gefunden habe, bei ihr bleiben. Schon allein dieses Angebot ist mehr als nur √ºberdurchschnittlich freundlich. Also auch hier nochmal ein riesiges DANKE!
Also eigentlich schlafe ich nicht bei Christian, sondern bei seine Mutter, Monika. Sie ist mindestens genauso freundlich wie Christian und hat sehr gute Ratschl√§ge bez√ºglich Hamburger Wohnungssuche im Petto. Ich habe schon ein leicht schlechtes Gewissen, da ich so herzlich aufgenommen werde aber nicht viel zur√ºckgeben kann. Ich will jetzt auch nicht zu viel schreiben und auch wenn es Christian nicht so recht gef√§llt, ich werde sehr gut ""bemuttert"". Trotzdem hoffe ich, bald eine Wohnung zu finden, damit ich euch nicht noch weiter auf die Nerven gehe.

When Florian arrived in Salzburg we went for a short round through the historic part of the city and up to one of our mountains. We spent all the time talking. Of course we had one big theme, our profession, but we also talked about loads and loads of others things. Florian is very well educated and intelligent person, which makes it easy to keep on talking with him for long hours :) 
We went home by electric trolley bus. At home we made some pizza and Christian came back home right before the pizza was ready. Christian found Florian sympathic by first sight and we had a nice chat the three of us. 
In the evening Christian had to go to the fire fighter station and I had to go to sleep because I had to get up at 3.00 am the next morning. So Christian took Florian with him and as far as the ""boys"" told me they had a lot of fun together until late at night. The next morning unfortunately I could not be at home, but my son very proudly and impressed told me that Florian made the table ready for breakfast and he even took some work from me by taking out the things from the dishwasher. Christian says that Florian is a very reasonable person, a responsible man at work, a good person for long talks and also someone who knows what he wants from life or as breakfast ;) 
Florian is also very respectful, he's careful with things and leaves a place as clean as he found it. 
I definitely do recommend to host him if you get the chance to, Florian is very thankful for all kind of positive couchsurfing-experiences and he welcomes those experiences with a wide opened heart, so if you ever get the chance to host him, don't miss this chance, he's a very special person and you will for sure have a great time when you host him.

I stayed tree nights on the couch there and I could have stayed even longer. Getting woken up with a big smile from this little guy was the best alarm clock ever. And Saskia is not just caring, warmhearted and respectful as Mom, she also is to her guests. From the very first day on I felt very comfortable. Between all the playgrounds we've visited she was never tired to share with me experiences and stories about life. Thank you for everything you two. It was a pleasure to meet you.

He walked like 5 steps ahead of me all the time as if we were perfect strangers. He was very sarcastic for German custom that I didnt know. Although I hold back my discomfort everytime he said something to me, I finally got very angry for his insulting remark.

When we had a casual Turkish dinner at a chain restaurant, I tried to leave the shop after the meal not knowing that payment should be done AFTER even at the Mcdonald like casual fast food place. (In my country, payment is done BEFORE at such a fast food place. Also, people can get a kind of slip that reminds them payment isnt done yet at restaurants.) Then, he stopped me saying, ""Hey, you need to pay for your stuff."" and I did. Later, he went on "" You can get foods for free in Japan, huh?"" in a very ironic tone. I finally reached my limit of patience and told him stop being sarcastic bout something I didnt know here thats very annoying.  He insisted he is perfectly right in every aspects and enjoy being sarcastic thats his style. 

I felt extremely disgusted and stopped talking to him completely and left his place in the early morning, which is clear sign of NO to him. Before leaving his place I blocked him all apps that we had contacted that also clearly shows my discomfort being with him.

 I simply wanted to forget this and move on as a traveler with limited time, yet when I figured he wrote me a reference I need to bother myself to write him back tho I didnt want to spare any negative energy anymore as Ive had enough with him.

Although her semester already started and she had to work a lot, she spend all of her remaining spare time with me. We had delicious breakfasts together and one evening cooked together.
The couch was the most cozy and comfortable bed i could imagine and she gave me her whole room in the students' flat-sharing community for the time i stayed there. Her roommates are also very caring, friendly and open people.

When me and my boyfriend came to Hamburg we were a little bit shy to wake our host up at 05:00am but he was taking a morning walk and he met us in a metro station and took us to his lovely home. He lives in a super cozy apartment, his room is very bright and he has great pictures in there. He let us sleep for a few hours because we were tired after a bus ride and meanwhile he even prepared breakfast for us!! Oh dear lord bless this guy üòÄ then he showed us the best spots of the city and we saw so much in only one day! He took us to see the panorama of Hamburg and later on we saw the whole city center while canoeing throughout the canals and had the best talks and great music the whole day.

Ale is a thoughtful guy. He has his own perspective about anything he see, or anything he does. His journey's quite challenging with the less amount of money but he made it so far with awesome hitchhiking experiences.

Me and David's history startet a couple of years back when I stayed in David's home during my trip through Central America.
Certain events early on in our friendship meant we got very close in a short amount of time.

As a guest, you can expect David to be helpful, giving and very respectful. David is a great guy to hang out with, and if you do, you are guaranteed a good time in the best company you can imagine.

David is also not the kind of Couchsurfer that expects you to keep him entertained - he is more than able to keep himself busy, which especially is very nice when you have a packed working schedule and arrive home late and tired.

My girlfriend and I enjoyed sharing our home with David, and he can consider our home his home anytime.

For example, after two days' stay, leaving some things at his place, and going to the coast for 5 days, I showed up at his front door without notice to retrieve my things and hopefully stay another day or two; although in a rush to leave for the day, he didn't think twice to welcome me, give me his keys, and bring me to a pharmacy for a burn I had.

Guys, let me tell you about a place few people go to, but that you have to visit! 

San Pedro Sula & David Diaz: 

Don't get scared from going here, it's a thing of the past.

When I arrived he kindly picked me up from the bus station, and w him I instantly felt like home. 
For me SPS is more like a quiet suburb than a million-people city. It's a chill place to hang out, and perfect if you been backpacking for a while and want something more ""normal"". He told me about all the local sites & stuff to do, but we ended up mostly just chilling and hanging out in his flat & going out w his family(including 2 dogs and a adorable nephew). The flat has all

I was lucky he wasn't too busy, so he had time to show me around. We went to try all the local foods, really delicious, the breakfast ""tortillas"" are the best(baleadas). 

If you have time to pass by SPS, do it, and stay w David!

17849213,"Hmm... What to say of such a unique couchsurfing experience I had with David?

I would start by saying: Dont go there if you're a jerk, you just dont deserve it! But that would be putting to much shadow on the picture.

I felt so lucky to be hosted by David since the first moment. Actually the second, when we went to eat baleadas, after I had entered an other car by accident and threw my backpack inside it hahaha.

To connect like this with somebody in a country that I visit give all the raison d'etre to this website. 

I had my first job as a professional photograph, that I very enjoyed, when we went to a wedding he was scheduled for. That took me so out of my comfort zone!
 Thanks for sharing me your clothes and your passions!

The day after, we did a photoshoot and I profoundly enjoyed the experience. I think we got very close that day, hermano. 

This is only 2 big lines but I could write so much more because it is all the rest that made this CS an unforgetable expericence. 

Ill keep it short, THANKS BRO! 

This guy is awesome!!

I hope you get more of this 10% of cs that worth it, like you said in your profile. Mostly, I wish you make tons of good friends in the weeks coming.

Yasir wrote me a very nice personal couch request, which I accepted. They arrived at the time we agreed, behaved correctly and respectfully.

He can talk on different subjects, also not so popular ones, being respectful and kind at the same time. The conversation with Yasir is never boring and you never know on which subject you will end up. Yasir is a serious, respectful man with strong principles and life objectives. Even a short contact with him gives confidence that the world (and science) will still develop, if there are people like him :). He does only what he believes in and that is also great.

We talked about very interesting things, deep things. Yasir, you are so friendly and so pleasant, thank you so much for those two days, OBRIGADO!
Our last hour together was eating a tasty (and spicy!) dinner that Yasir have cooked, a dish from Pakistan! Was a wonderful food, a thousand thank you!

I wish next time you can stay in my home with my family :) You'll be very very welcome here. Return whenever you want and spend the time you want.

Just a suggestion: Don‚Äôt trust the appearances‚Ä¶. He might seem apparently quiet, rather kind and gentle, but under the mask he hides a really evil soul :D . After some time spent together I‚Äôve noticed he is the most racist sexist, fundamentalist, adventurist, astrophysicist [‚Ä¶] person ever met! :P
But at the same time is hard to let him go :)

Update: The more we talk together, the more I am fascinated by the experiences he had during his life.
He has deep values and he knows himself a lot: his self confidence and energy are contageous!
His nature is deeply friendly, easygoing and relaxed but at the same time he is aggressively opinioned and stubborn somehow.
You can learn a lot from him!

Yasir and his friends Safiq, Shelbi and Naim hosted Mathias and me for one night in their all-Pakistani flat in Padova...
Our short trip to Padova started bad (it was raining cats and dogs)...but immediately got better when we entered their home :) We were served great Pakistani food and wonderful Chai...and we got a crash-course in Pakistani culture: music, strange utube vids,and (my favourite) PLAYING CARDS :D 
Before going to sleep we were listening to stories about snakes and ghosts and we were offered an insight into the Pakistani look onto this world...
And last but not least, Yasir did a sightseeing trip through Padova with us...and shared all his knowledge about this beautiful city with us...

Ingo really is a very nice guy, friendly, open-minded, sociable, communicative...and these are just some of the reason, why it is a good decision, to offer him a couch! Although we only had a few hours with him, it was a great time: very informative and friendly! And the best thing: it didnt feel as if we were totally unknown to each other 'cause we had a lot to talk about!

So, THANKS A LOT for your openness, the book and the dinner :)!!

You're welcome at any time!

She introduced me to German music which turned out to be so much better than the circulated 'German music reputation' that ever got to me (how ignorant I have been!). 

We cooked and walked and talked a lot. She facilitated my first German city biking experience ever. She sang and did little dances and hummed a lot, making it felt like home with a fun flatmate. I had the luck to meet her friends as well. They were excellent ambassadors of Hamburg, making me feel like it's one of the best cities of Germany.

The couch was in the living room. It's not that big, but I managed to sleep on it, so will you. He also respected when I was tired and wanted to sleep.

BUT: this reference is for him as a person and not for the flat. If you are staying one night and/or don't need much to be comfortable, you`ll be fine. If you prefer a cleaner apartment and other surroundings, you should probably look for something else.

I only stayed one night with Annegret, spending one all-too-short evening and disgustingly early morning with her and her boyfriend Flo. Our communication and plans up to finally meeting in person didn't run as smoothly as hoped, but all of that was blown from my mind once we met. If I had been in Rostock longer, I'm sure some kind of artistic (acting/music/illustration) collaboration would have emerged and Annegret would probably have mastered unicycling within a few days (simply because her dedication and enthusiasm for creating and learning is a force to be reckoned with). Apart from these sparkling superpowers, Annegret is also kind, understanding, interesting to talk to and, at times, simply ludicrously ridiculous in the best of ways (all of which - except perhaps for the ridiculousness - is also and equally true of Flo btw.). Simply looking through her bookshelves was a highly interesting experience in itself and having a fabulous vegan breakfast (unbelievably delicous homemade smoothies!) as well as a personal escort in Annegret, Flo and Spaceman Spiff all the way to the ferry this early in the morning was probably the best possible way to start the day!

Eles visitaram as Cataratas do Iguacu do lado brasileiro e fizeram o passeio de  aventura Macuco Saf√°ri, que consiste em subir pelo rio at√© perto da Garganta do Diabo ....  e ver as cataratas por baixo!  Voltaram totalmente ensopados e felizes.
Foram ao mercado, pegaram v√°rios √¥nibus e se viraram muito bem, no √∫ltimo dia eu os levei at√© o Marco das Tr√™s Fronteiras de onde puderam ver as fronteiras entre Brazil, Paraguai e Argentina onde Merle tirou lindas fotos com sua super c√¢mera, filtros e t√©cnicas 
 
Nos despedimos na noite anterior a viagem deles porque t√≠nhamos um compromisso de madrugada e eles partiam antes de nosso retorno, nossa casa sempre estar√° a disposi√ß√£o e sim vamos incluir Hamburgo em nosso roteiro pela Alemanha para visit√°-los.

Agradecemos muito a gentileza em nosso jantar de despedida

Abra√ßos

Interesting enough to impulsively decide to visit him at his place when I was on my way back to Germany. Since Saarbrucken (no offence) is not well-known as The Typical German City (never even met a German from there), we joked that this would be perfect place for my smooth come back to the culture, language and traditions. What can I say, we had potatoes for dinner - so that‚Äôs a good start. But when it came to languages, I pretty much FAILED!

Luckily, Manav has a great, smart and outstanding sense of humor and culturally and stereotypically related jokes and puns are his Steckenpferd (how we would say it in German). I am glad I gave him a lot of material that he could make jokes about - great match, no? 

When my face muscles hurt too much from laughing, we were also able to have more serious conversations or would maybe say nothing at all and enjoy a beautiful hike to the Saarschleife with a beautiful view! Very neat.
